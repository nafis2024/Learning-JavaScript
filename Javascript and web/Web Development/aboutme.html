        <h2>About my past:</h2>
        <p>I was not born in Chattorgram but it is where I had most of my memories on, mainly because I spent 5 years on my life in there and made my first highschool friends. <br>
        It's true that I don't miss them anymore but yeah, those were the folks I grew up with. <br>
        I didn't knew that I am going to change that much after leaving that place but 3 years seem like a lot. <br>
        I met many perks which made the "Settling to Dhaka" worth it but admitting into Milestone still felt like the worst decision of all.</p>
